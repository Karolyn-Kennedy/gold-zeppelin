   <h1>The Chaika</h1>
   <p>The decade from 1950 to 1960 in the global automotive design is a period of experimentation and search for new stylistic solutions, forms, materials and technologies, which contributed to the rapid obsolescence of cars.</p> 
   <p>It all started with work on the modernization of ZIM, but it soon became clear that the style of the car was hopelessly outdated, and it was impossible to modernize it through restyling and modernization.</p>
   <p>Initially, there were two variants of the name of the project - "Chaika" and "Arrow", in the end the first was chosen.</p> 
   <p>According to legend, one of the designers, when asked why the Seagull won, answered: <strong><em>"Imagine the Volga. Who is flying over her? Seagull. So it is with us: "Volga", and above it - "The Chaika".</em></strong></p>
   <p>The Chaika design has completely new proportions: a long-wheelbase body with three rows of side windows and an original design.</p> 
   <p>Similar visors over the headlights were used by</p> 
   <ul>
     <li>Packard cars of 1955 and 1956,</li><br/>

     <li>Plymouth (1955-1956)</li><br/>

     <li>and other brands, the prototype of this style was the Xpt-100-Concert Ford 1953.</li><br/>

   </ul>
   <p>The design of the tail section of the "The Chaika" resembled the then corporate identity of the <a href="https://www.gm.com/" target="_blank">General Motors concern</a>, which was used on Chevrolet (1956-1957), Pontiac (1957), Buick (1955-1958), Holden (1960-1962) cars.</p>
   <p>Most of the design elements were characteristic of the "Detroit Baroque" of those years.</p>
